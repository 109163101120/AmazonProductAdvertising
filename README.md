Need help using the Amazon Product Advertising API? Here you go!

I struggled to figure out how to use the Amazon Product Advertising API. I found a resource online (the files in the AmazonAPI folder), but they had a bug in them. I finally got it working.

Then I wrote the AmazonQuery.cs file JUST FOR YOU!! This will help you with the ProductSearch and ItemLookup API queries. 

YOU WILL NEED AMAZON ASSOCIATE CREDENTIALS!
See here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSECommerceService/latest/DG/CHAP_GettingStarted.html

In the AmazonKeys.config file, there is a place for you to put YOUR API access information. Be sure not to share those. 

After you have your credentials, I recommend playing around with the Amazon Scratchpad to get an idea of the kinds of information you can get:

I don't know who wrote the files in the AmazonAPI file. I couldn't remember where I got them, but they're a beast! So thank you to whoever wrote those! They essentially turn the Amazon response (XML) into objects you can use. I've been able to do some awesome things because of that, and I hope you do to!

I've put some comments in the Program file to help make it easy. There is more you can do by modifying the AmazonQuery.cs file. I wrote just wrote basic ItemLookup and ItemSearch methods to get you started. 

GOOD LUCK!!!
